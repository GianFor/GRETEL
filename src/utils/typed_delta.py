"""Typed edit set between a graph G and a counterfactual G'.

Nodes are matched by index, the same assumption graph_edit_distance_metric
makes: node i of G is node i of G'. When the two graphs differ in size, the
extra indices are reported as added or removed nodes, and every edge that
touches them lands in edges_added or edges_removed.

The delta has one list per edit type:

    nodes_added, nodes_removed     node indices
    edges_added, edges_removed     [u, v] pairs, u < v for undirected graphs
    features_changed               {node, feature, from, to} for nodes present
                                   in both graphs

Edge features and edge weights are not compared: the oracles in use ignore
them, so editing them cannot flip a prediction.
